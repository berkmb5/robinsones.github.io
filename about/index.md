I am a data science student in [Metis'](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) 2016 summer cohort. I graduated in June from INSEAD with a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). Before INSEAD, I earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions. I also earned a statistics minor.
