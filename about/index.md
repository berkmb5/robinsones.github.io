I am a data science student in [Metis's](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) 2016 New York City summer cohort. I graduated in June from INSEAD with a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). Before INSEAD, I earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions. I also earned a statistics minor. 

I grew up in New York City, moved to Houston for college and then spent two years in Fontainebleau, France attending INSEAD. Because of INSEAD's two-campus system, I also got to live for a few months in Singapore. I love all animals and consider myself part of the [#rcatladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rcatladies) despite not owning a cat. I do have a dog, Abby, who consistently surprises mountain hikers and Central Park joggers alike with her athletic ability.
