Last week I got to spend four amazing days in Orlando at the first ever [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/). In this post, I share some of what I learned from the conference along with my personal experience. Since it's a long post,  I’ve divided it up into sections to make it easier to navigate if you’re just interested in part of the post:

* Introduction 
* Helpful Links Related to the Conference
* Training Days
* Functional Programming
* Writing Packages
* Hadley's Tips and Tricks
* Some Packages, Tools, and Functions I learned 
* Tips and Tricks from the Tutorials 
* Keyboard Shortcuts 
* Personal Notes
* In the Future

## Introduction
First, I want to thank RStudio for providing the diversity scholarship that enabled me to attend the conference at all. When I applied for the scholarship, I was just finishing up [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) and about to start my job search. Without a company to pay for my ticket and not knowing when I would start earning a salary again, I could not have covered the $1000+ for the conference ticket and travel. 

The scholarship covered not only the cost of the conference, the Harry Potter World social event, and a small amount of travel money, but also, to my surprise, a ticket for the training days. The training days costs $1,300, so even though I'm now at Etsy, which has some conference funding available, I do not think there's any other way I would have been able to attend this. 

I believe the R community is one of the most welcoming communities in technology, with many in it continuously trying to improve the diversity of the community and the experience of those in it who aren’t straight white men. The R Foundation Task Force on Women recently rebranded themselves to Forwards so that they could "consider the needs of other marginalised groups as part of our mission." They released their [findings from a demographic survey taken at UseR](https://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/mapping-users/), the major conference for r users.

This organizational schema was inspired by Hilary Parker's great talk on [Opinionated Analysis Development](http://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development))
* RStudio will also be posting video from most (all?) of the talks, which I'll add here when they're available
