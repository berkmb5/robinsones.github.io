title: A Community's of One's Own
---

I learned a lot in my two years at INSEAD getting a master’s in Organizational Behavior. I believe that many of the skills and knowledge I gained there will be beneficial as a data scientist, from defining a problem to carrying out a thoughtful analysis to communicating to a range of audiences. But one skill I didn’t feel I was developing was working in an industry-style coding ecosystem.

This hit home one day in this spring. In one of my classes where we had been writing code in STATA, the professor wanted us to be able to see the code the other students had written. So naturally, he suggested we create a shared dropbox folder and share it there. I don’t think he had ever heard of Github, let alone tried to use it. 

The downside of being at a stand-alone business school was that I didn’t have a community of programmers. A few students use Python extensively in their research and even put together a 2-day beginner Python workshop for professor and PhD students. On the first day, the student teacher showed how you could use pygeocoder to get the location of a list of universities. A professor sitting in on the class exclaimed, “I've spent five hours doing that before!” 

I was fortune to attend Rice University and take classes from and designed by Hadley Wickham, perhaps the most prominent developer of packages for R (he has even been referred to as [the man who revolutionaized R ](http://priceonomics.com/hadley-wickham-the-man-who-revolutionized-r/). I didn't fully appreciate the amazing opportunity I was getting at that time, even though my brother Dave was insanely jealous I had personally knew the great Hadley Wickham. Now Dave has far surpassed me, having:

* [Built packages](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom) that are becoming a core part of the what Hadley would like us to call "the tidy-verse" (instead of the "Hadley verse")
* Become one of the relatively small number of people Hadley follows on Twitter (and also retweets a lot)
* Had cocktails made for him by Hadley at the rOpenSci Unconference

But I will still always get to say I knew him first. 

This meant that I've been programming in R for almost five years,
