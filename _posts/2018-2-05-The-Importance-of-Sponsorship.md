In my [last post](https://robinsones.github.io/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Reaching-Out/), I discussed the importance of building your network and some strategies for effectively reaching out. I closed with emphasizing how helpful your peers or people one step ahead of you can be. But there's a specific area where people with more resources, status, or experience can help you: sponsorship. 

## What is sponsorship? 

When people discuss what they're seeking from a more senior person in their field, they usually talk about "mentorship." Generally, mentoring involves offering advice, helping someone adjust to their new job, or giving feedback on their work. Sponsoship, on the other hand, is all about giving people opportunities, whether by funding them, advocating for their promotion, introducing them to important people, or making sure they get assigned to projects that can help them grow.  
  
A lot of articles about sponsorship and mentorship are about the finding one at your company. And that is important if you work at a larger organization and want to stay in your company for many years rising through the ranks. But nowadays people often change companies every few years, especially in tech. And the tech community has enough small subpockets that you can start building a positive reputation and sponsors in the larger field who will stay with you through multiple companies. 

## How do you find a sponsor? 

Just like other relationships, looking for a sponsor can be very awkward if you force it. Don't just cold-email someone or go up to a famous stranger at a meetup and ask, "will you be my sponsor?" In my [previous post]([https://robinsones.github.io/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Reaching-Out/]), I discussed how offering value and building a mutually fulfilling relationship is the best way to network. 

This applies doubly to sponsorship. If someone sponsors you, they need to be confident you will do a good job, because you're representing them. For example, if someone recommends you as a speaker for a conference and you never respond to the organizer or you give a clearly unprepared talk, that reflects poorly on the sponsor. 

So how can you show someone you're up for the task? One of the best ways is to have public examples of your previous successful work. It doesn't have to be evidence of you doing the exact same thing; otherwise, how could you ever get your first opportunity? [Mikhil Popov's](https://mpopov.com/) wrote a [great post](https://mpopov.com/blog/advice-for-grads-entering-industry-datasci) on how to deal with this kind of catch-22, specifically needing experience as a data scientist to get a job as a data scientist. He said that your experience doesn't need to be at a job with the title "data scientist;" what experience really stands for is showing you can do the work by sharing an end-to-end data project (gathering, cleaning, modeling, and visualizing) on real data and explaining it. 

For example, if you've never done a full talk before, start with a lightning talk. Many meetups have them and encourage first-time speakers to apply. Or [write a blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) about a cool analysis you did. 

## How can you be a sponsor? 

If you're a seasoned speaker, think about recommending others for opportunities, especially when you can't go yourself, like Julia Evans recently did:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get email about a lot of speaking opportunities. if you&#39;re looking to give more talks (especially if you&#39;re from a marginalized group), reply to this with a link to a video of a talk you&#39;re proud of!</p>&mdash; üîéJulia Evansüîç (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/960884397644898305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

Caitlin Hudon has a great twitter thread on this. https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/895799250055024640. Some examples she give: colleagues praising her work in front of her boss, sharing their salary information, asking about parental leave policy, and promoting work of women. Latter can even be just tweeting. Asking what you can do better. Support women-focused group, offering time, training materials, meeting spaces, etc. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Below are examples of &quot;good guys in tech&quot; and things they have done that have helped my career. I hope others can follow their example.</p>&mdash; Caitlin Hudonüë©üèº‚Äçüíª (@beeonaposy) <a href="https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/895799250055024640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

## My sponsorship

Some examples of how my sponsors have accelerated my career: 
- I attended my first data science conference, RStudio::conf 2017, thanks to a diversity scholarship that allowed me to go to conference and training days for free and included a small travel budget. 
- I gave my first data science talk because Jared Lander asked me when, not if, I wanted to speak at his meetup. He believed I could do it before I did, and was a very enthusiastic champion of me. The talk was recorded and was seen by the Director of the Data Science Center at West Point, who invited me to give a talk there last September (it was awesome). 
- I gave my first conference talk at Data Day Texas two weeks ago because Hilary Parker and other invited speakers recommended me.  

And actions that don't rise to the level of sponsorship also can make a big impact. Specifically, I want to thank Hadley Wickham, for encouraging me to submit my talk to RStudio conference 2018: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You should submit it to rstudio::conf!</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/900828594703880198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2017</a></blockquote>

And Jim Hester citing me as one of the contributors to the glue documentation.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to give a belated shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/jimhester_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jimhester_</a> and the tidyverse team for providing a really nice experience to a OS newbie:<br><br>A month ago, I was trying to use a new function in glue and getting an error it didn‚Äôt exist. Colleague was pinging me about same error. 1/</p>&mdash; Emily Robinson (@robinson_es) <a href="https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/930814430362984448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

Finally, I am incredibly lucky to have my amazing brother Dave Robinson. He has been my most encouraging data science sponsor and is a tireless advocate for women in data science in general. His tweets on international women's day got all of us mentioned a lot more followers: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Five amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> data scientists to follow if you&#39;re not already:<a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@juliasilge</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JennyBryan</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hspter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ma_salmon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ma_salmon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/robinson_es?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@robinson_es</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD2017?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IWD2017</a> <a href="https://t.co/OWqi0PzyWM">pic.twitter.com/OWqi0PzyWM</a></p>&mdash; David Robinson (@drob) <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/839564664321282048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

## Diversity and sponsorship

Care about diversity. This one is about how men can be an ally to women and non-binary people. Worth reading whole thing: https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/. Important post below: 

Screenshot. 

What if I'm a man and I'm worried with #metoo? Read this: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/men-afraid-mentor-women-heres-what-we-can-do-adam-grant/. Some key points - hold yourself accountable for parity, if you won't go to dinner alone with a woman, don't do it with a man. And ask a woman what she's comfortable with. But there is plenty of sponsorship you can do in public situations. 

- Women are overmentored and undersponsored https://hbr.org/2010/08/women-are-over-mentored-but-un

  - Women have as many if not more mentors, but men's mentors more likely to be senior. Men correlation between mentor and promotion, women not

http://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/ - people often need opportunity and visibility, not advice. You can sponsor people without them knowing it. Help people get the experience and demonstrate skill they need to advance by giving them opportunities. 

Use the influence you have, even if it may not be formal.

Lara gives some good advice that's mostly applicable to sponsoring colleagues. 

https://www.deconstructconf.com/speak - some conferences are explicitly for or encouraging to new speakers, especitlaly those from underrepesneted backgrounds
