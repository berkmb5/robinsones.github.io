### Try to find a connection
Connection can be something you share - maybe you both went to same school or same bootcamp. Or maybe they have some kind of hobby you share that they've talked about? Or even a previous career if their background is also political science, for example. 

Can also be a person you know who connects you. Ask for suggestions from them, but don't demand. Don't talk to someone just to get an intro to someone else. For example, recently Julia Silge, a data scientist at StackOverflow, connected me to [Lukas Vermeer](https://lukasvermeer.github.io), a data scientist at booking.com. He was interested in talking to people about their company's experimentation set-up. We had a great conversation. And I introduced him to Sarah Manning, manager of our analytics engineering team. Note: double opt-in intro (hat tip [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/893953892404297728), Julia did, I did, but good reminder important practice). 

So can try to find people who can connect you (maybe alumni office or career center) or acquantice. 

### Get specific
In-person - don't just say "I love you work!" Over email - make sure you mention their work. Both cases, get more specific - how has it helped you, which blog post or package, etc. Avoids awkward exchange - You: "I love your work" Them: "Great, thank you." Both: awkward silence ... Help them help you by giving a conversation topic. 

Also about what you're interested in talking about (Trey Causey). Don't just ask to "pick their brain" or if they "have time for a quick chat." 

Mark Meloon (tell them you like their work, combine that with request, usually doesn't get that).  

### Offer value

Mark Meloon - don't just be taking. Don't ask for referral right away. If they can do it and they know you're searching and they want to, they'll do it. 

Adam Grant - accomplishing things leads to network. Henning - don't worry about knowing people, be worth knowing.

* "Accomplishing great things helps you develop a network". Have a public body of work. Go read [Dave's blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) on why you should start a blog and also the how. . Medium is a great way to get started easily, also can get you wider visibility, but Jekyll too. Having code on github is good, but data scientists also need communication skills. Plus just more likely people will read that than 1000s of lines of barely commented code. 

### Meeting people in person

Stick around after the meetup, there might be an after-event (e.g. (New York Open Statistical Programming meetup)[https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/] invites everyone to the bar after the meetup) but also it will be less crowded as people leave right away but other stay around and hang out. 

Can talk to organizers after, they're friendly, introduce yourself and thank them. 

If you're nervous about going somewhere where you don't know anyone, can bring a friend, but don't just stick with them. 

### Twitter
Rstats community on twitter friendly. Can announce going to conference. Can ask questions. Can be way to break ice at conference (personal brand developer post). I met people like Jenny Bryan at RStudio I had only followed on twitter, but helped me "know" her a bit. Personal brand article. You'll often find Hadley Wickham answering questions (although I think it's more polite to use #rstats than to @ him directly, but I often see him answering questions directed to him). 

### Following up
- if they respond and helped you with something - follow up! For example, if you were looking for a job, let them know when you found one and thank them. 
- if you were introduced to them or have a connecton and haven't heard back - give them a few weeks and follow up. 
- if cold introduction, use your judgment maybe not. 

Don't take non-responses personally. People are busy, sometimes email slips through. Don't know what is happening in their personal life. 

Read great post by Trey Causey on sending a cold email. Go ahead, I'll wait: https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d. Shows specifically how to revise an email.

* "But it’s remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you’ve already put something valuable out into the world. That’s what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take."
*  "Do something interesting, and instead of having to push your way in, you’ll get pulled in. The network comes to you."
*  "It shouldn’t be about promoting yourself, but about promoting your ideas." - my take, it can also be about helping other people. For example, writing my first data science talk. 

[Mark Meloon advice](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) on networking
- "But most of the messages are all about “getting something”, not legitimate attempts to build any kind of relationship. 

Most of the messages I get are like the above, where someone asks me out of the blue if we have any openings. Sometimes people will be as bold as to ask me if I could refer them"
-" But this individual made no attempt to try to establish any kind of relationship with me. I’m simply a tool to help him get what he wants."
- "Every once in awhile, I get an open-ended request to get on a phone or Skype call so someone can “pick my brain”. No duration specified, no agenda. No specific questions. They want me to drop everything I’m doing and let them pepper me with every question they can think of."
- "The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements.

Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an “I’d love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?” to their message."
- " If you are going to reach out to experienced data scientists, don’t make your first message all about you and what you want. Make it about them (mostly). Comment on something they’ve posted. Point them to a helpful resource. Offer to share their content. Maybe ask them something about their profile."

Things that I've gotten to do based on public talks and blog
- West Point talk (show photo) 
- Robert Chang (shared his work, he reached out to me, had read my stuff too)
- RStudio Conference (had an example talk to link them to) 
- Saw other people inspired by my talk write their own (share tweet about her blog post)

- it's for developers, but I think applies equally to data science. 
- disagree on blogging "light" but agree with this: Finally, try and remember that all your posts don’t have to be too technical. Even if you are a complete beginner, you will always have 1 day, 1 week or 1 month’s more experience than someone else. Someone will find value in what you have to say. 
- It can be worthwhile I think not just using it to have a presence and way of contact but to add value. Takes more time, but I think that time can also be learning time in this field. 
- It’s also a great way to break the ice and say a virtual “hello” before bumping into someone at an in-person conference or meet-up.
