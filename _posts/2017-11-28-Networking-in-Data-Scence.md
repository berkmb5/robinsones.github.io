### Try to find a connection
Connection can be something you share - maybe you both went to same school or same bootcamp. Or maybe they have some kind of hobby you share that they've talked about? 

Can also be a person who connects you. For example, recently Julia Silge, a data scientist at StackOverflow, connected me to Lukas X, a data scientist at booking.com. We had a great conversation. And I introduced him to Sarah Manning, our experimentation engineer. Note: double opt-in intro (hat tip Lara Hogan, Julia did, I did, but good reminder important practice). 

So can try to find people who can connect you (maybe alumni office or career center) or acquantice. 

### Get specific
In-person - don't just say "I love you work!" Over email - make sure you mention their work. Both cases, get more specific - how has it helped you, which blog post or package, etc. Avoids awkward exchange - You: "I love your work" Them: "Great, thank you." Both: awkward silence ... Help them help you by giving a conversation topic. 

Also about what you're interested in talking about (Trey Causey). Don't just ask to "pick their brain" or if they "have time for a quick chat." 

Mark Meloon (tell them you like their work, combine that with request, usually doesn't get that).  

### Offering value

Adam Grant - accomplishing things leads to network. 

### Following up
- if they respond and helped you with something - follow up! For example, if you were looking for a job, let them know when you found one and thank them. 


Read great post by Trey Causey on sending a cold email. Go ahead, I'll wait: https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d. Shows specifically how to revise an email. 

[Adam Grant article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/opinion/sunday/networking-connections-business.html?_r=0)
* "Accomplishing great things helps you develop a network". Have a public body of work. Go read [Dave's blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) on why you should start a blog and also the how. . Medium is a great way to get started easily, also can get you wider visibility, but Jekyll too. Having code on github is good, but data scientists also need communication skills. Plus just more likely people will read that than 1000s of lines of barely commented code. 
* "But it’s remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you’ve already put something valuable out into the world. That’s what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take."
*  "Do something interesting, and instead of having to push your way in, you’ll get pulled in. The network comes to you."
*  "It shouldn’t be about promoting yourself, but about promoting your ideas." - my take, it can also be about helping other people. For example, writing my first data science talk. 

[Mark Meloon advice](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) on networking
- "But most of the messages are all about “getting something”, not legitimate attempts to build any kind of relationship. 

Most of the messages I get are like the above, where someone asks me out of the blue if we have any openings. Sometimes people will be as bold as to ask me if I could refer them"
-" But this individual made no attempt to try to establish any kind of relationship with me. I’m simply a tool to help him get what he wants."
- "Every once in awhile, I get an open-ended request to get on a phone or Skype call so someone can “pick my brain”. No duration specified, no agenda. No specific questions. They want me to drop everything I’m doing and let them pepper me with every question they can think of."
- "The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements.

Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an “I’d love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?” to their message."
- " If you are going to reach out to experienced data scientists, don’t make your first message all about you and what you want. Make it about them (mostly). Comment on something they’ve posted. Point them to a helpful resource. Offer to share their content. Maybe ask them something about their profile."

Things that I've gotten to do based on public talks and blog
- West Point talk (show photo) 
- Robert Chang (shared his work, he reached out to me, had read my stuff too)
- RStudio Conference (had an example talk to link them to) 
- Saw other people inspired by my talk write their own (share tweet about her blog post)
