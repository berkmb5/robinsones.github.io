Whether in applying for a job, getting a promotion, or establishing a reputation in your broader field, you've probably heard something along the lines of "it's all about who you know." So how does one go about building this all-important network? By sending out a unsolicited million linkedin with no messages to every person with the title "data science," making it a goal to hand out 20 business cards at a meetup once a week, or sending messages to prominent data scientists with the subject line "Can I pick you brain?"

**Absolutely not**.

Building a network is not a numbers game, and it's not about looking to get the largest personal benefit with the least time invested. But unfortunately that's how some people approach it. I wrote this post to offer some suggestions for a better way. 

Two important cavaets to start, both inspired by other posts on similar topics. First, to quote [Trey Causey](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d): I am not without sin, and I'm also still figuring all this out. And second, for those of you who hate the very idea of networking and think your work should speak for yourself, I really like Rachel Thomas' take on this. She's writing about personal brand, but I think there's a lot of overlap there (as I discuss later): 

> Personal branding is no substitute for doing high-quality technical work; it’s just the means by which you can share this work with a broader audience.

## How to Grow your Community Generally 

### Attend meetups

There are a lot of great data science communities. If you're in New York, I highly recommend the (New York Open Statistical Programming meetup)[https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/]; if you're a woman, check out groups like [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), [Women who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), and [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/), all of which have chapters all over the world. Stick around after the meetup; there might be an after-event (the NY Open Statistical Programming meetup invites everyone to a bar after the meetup), but even if there isn't, some people will likely stay around and you can meet them when it's less crowded and you have a natural discussion topic (the talk you both just heard). You can also talk to the organizers; they're almost definitely friendly folks and can maybe introduce you to others who share your interests. If you're nervous about going somewhere where you don't know anyone, you can bring a friend, but don't just talk with them the entire time. 

### Try out twitter

There's a great, friendly R community on twitter. You can announce when you're going to conference, ask technical questions, and share your work. It can also be a way to break the ice when you finally meet someone in person. For example, I ran into Jenny Bryan last year at RStudio::conf; we'd never talked before, but I been following her on twitter which helped me "know" her a bit. You can even [say a "virtual" hello](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-your-personal-brand-as-a-new-web-developer-f6d4150fd217) beforehand if you know you'll both be at the same conference.

On the technical question side, you can try out the rstats hashtag. Just the other week [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/943500138265399296) asking if anyone could advise on setting a global color palette for ggplot2. I got a lot of good responses, including one introducing me to the awesome [ggthemr package](https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr). I then paid it forward by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/943549279595126785) about the discovery. You'll often even find Hadley Wickham answering questions on twitter; I think it's more polite to use the rstats hashtag rather than to @ him directly, but he usually answers questions directed by him as well.  

## How to Reach Out to Specific People

### Offer value

True networking is about building a relationship, not a one-sided demand where you just want to get something immediately. And the best way to build mutually fulfilling relationships is to have something of value to offer in return. 

Don't ask for a referral in your first message to a person. If they can do it and you have a good conversation where you mention you're looking, they'll probably offer. 

*  "It shouldn’t be about promoting yourself, but about promoting your ideas." - my take, it can also be about helping other people. For example, writing my first data science talk. 

While people sometimes think you need a network to accomplish great things, it actually mostly goes the other way. Adam Grant wrote about this in a [recent article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/opinion/sunday/networking-connections-business.html?_r=0)

> My students often believe that if they simply meet more important people, their work will improve. But it’s remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you’ve already put something valuable out into the world. That’s what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take.

> Sure, you can fire off cold emails to people you respect — they’re just a click away — but you’ll be lucky if 2 percent even reply. The best way to attract a mentor is to create something worthy of the mentor’s attention. Do something interesting, and instead of having to push your way in, you’ll get pulled in. The network comes to you.

In sum, [don't worry about who you know, but be worth knowing.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d63bc4e4b0e383f5b2a05a/t/5655fa1de4b0f60cdb986ad5/1448475165543/Job+market+advice+for+PhDs+November2015-2.pdf). 

Have a public body of work. Go read [Dave's blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) on why you should start a blog and also the how. . Medium is a great way to get started easily, also can get you wider visibility, but Jekyll too. Having code on github is good, but data scientists also need communication skills. Plus just more likely people will read that than 1000s of lines of barely commented code. 

Build your personal brand. http://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/.

- It can be worthwhile I think not just using it to have a presence and way of contact but to add value. Takes more time, but I think that time can also be learning time in this field. 

### Share what you like about their work

A friend who's well-known in the R community shared how many of his first conversations at meetups or conferences go: 

> Them: "I love your work!"

> My friend: "Great, thank you."

> Both: awkward silence ...

Whether it's over email or in-person, tell the other person **which part of their work** helped you and how. For example, if you run into [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) at Rstudio::conf, you could say, "Thank you so much for sharing data science work on twitter! The other day you tweeted a cheatsheet for lubridate, and I shared it with my coworkers right away. I really like how you include screenshots when linking to blog posts, so I can get a quick preview." Help them help you to by coming up with a good conversation topic. 

Over email, it's even more important to show you're familiar with their work. [Mark Meloon](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) describes this well:

> The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements. Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an “I’d love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?” to their message.

And if you don't know anything about their work, and they do have a public presence (either github, a blog, or twitter), why are you reaching out? Just like when applying for a job, you should do some research. If they have a post on what they think of the [data science job market](http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html), don't message them "what can you tell me about the data science job market?" Show them you've read their work and ask follow-up questions. 

### Find a connection

Try to find if you have something in common with the other person. Maybe you both went to same school or same bootcamp. Do you have a similar educational background or career, especially one that is not traditional?  It doesn't have to be career-related; maybe you both have the same a non-tech hobby or spent time living abroad in the same country. Check with your school or bootcamp's career center to see if there is someone at a company you're interested in. 

A mutual acquaintice can also serve as a connection. If you have a good conversion with someone, you can ask them (not demand) if they know anyone else in the same field.<sup>1</sup> For example, recently Julia Silge, a data scientist I know at StackOverflow, asked if she could connect me to [Lukas Vermeer](https://lukasvermeer.github.io), a data scientist at booking.com. He was interested in talking to people about their company's experimentation set-up, and we had a great conversation. I then introduced him to Sarah Manning, the manager of our analytics engineering team, as she had talked to some of his colleagues at a conference. Important Note: when doing introductions, always do a **double opt-in introduction** (hat tip [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/893953892404297728) for this advice).

### Get specific

Trey Causey wrote a great [post](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d) called "Do you have time for a quick chat?" on sending a cold email. Go ahead and read it, I'll wait. He does a really nice job breaking down how to write a great request email and set up a meeting for success. A key point: have an agenda of what you want to discuss and share it with them. If you just ask to "pick their brain," it comes off as you wanting the person to [drop everything just so you can assail them](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) with any question you can think of, potentially for hours. 

### Following up

If you have a good conversation with someone and they help you with something, follow up! For example, if you were looking for a job, let them know when you found one and thank them.  

If you were introduced to someone or have a connection with them and haven't heard back, give them a week or two and follow up. Sometimes emails just fall through the cracks and they'll appreciate being reminded. If it's a cold email, use your judgment about whether to follow up. 

Finally, don't take non-responses personally. People are busy, and you don't know what is happening in their personal life.

[Mark Meloon advice](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) on networking
- "But most of the messages are all about “getting something”, not legitimate attempts to build any kind of relationship. 

Most of the messages I get are like the above, where someone asks me out of the blue if we have any openings. Sometimes people will be as bold as to ask me if I could refer them"
-" But this individual made no attempt to try to establish any kind of relationship with me. I’m simply a tool to help him get what he wants."
- "Every once in awhile, I get an open-ended request to get on a phone or Skype call so someone can “pick my brain”. No duration specified, no agenda. No specific questions. They want me to drop everything I’m doing and let them pepper me with every question they can think of."
- "The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements.

Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them.

- " If you are going to reach out to experienced data scientists, don’t make your first message all about you and what you want. Make it about them (mostly). Comment on something they’ve posted. Point them to a helpful resource. Offer to share their content. Maybe ask them something about their profile."

[Mentoring post](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stop-asking-people-to-mentor-you/)

Asking a virtual stranger to mentor you probably isn't going to get you far. "The strongest relationships spring out of a real and often earned connection felt by both sides." Studies, she writes, "show that mentors select proteges based on performance and potential." Given this, "I believe we have sent the wrong message to young women. We need to stop telling them, 'Get a mentor and you will excel.' Instead, we need to tell them, 'Excel and you will get a mentor.'

### My benefits

Things that I've gotten to do based on public talks and blog
- West Point talk (show photo) 
- Robert Chang (shared his work, he reached out to me, had read my stuff too)
- RStudio Conference (had an example talk to link them to) 
- Saw other people inspired by my talk write their own (share tweet about her blog post) 

[1] Never talk to someone just to get an introduction to someone else.
