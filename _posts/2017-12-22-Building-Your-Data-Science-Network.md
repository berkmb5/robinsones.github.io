# Part 1

## Growing your Community Generally 

### Attend Meetups

There are a lot of great data science communities. If you're in New York, I highly recommend the [New York Open Statistical Programming meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/); if you're a woman, check out groups like [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), [Women who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), and [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/), all of which have chapters all over the world. Stick around after the meetup; there might be an after-event (the NY Open Statistical Programming meetup invites everyone to a bar after the meetup), but even if there isn't, some people will likely stay around and you can meet them when it's less crowded and you have a natural discussion topic (the talk you both just heard). You can also talk to the organizers; they're almost definitely friendly folks and can maybe introduce you to others who share your interests. 

If you're nervous about going somewhere where you don't know anyone, you can bring a friend, but don't just talk with them the entire time. And if you go alone, look for groups following the pacman rule: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Love the Pacman Rule: When standing as a group of people, always leave room for 1 person to join your group. <a href="https://t.co/eBi0gT19yl">https://t.co/eBi0gT19yl</a>  Ht <a href="https://twitter.com/gnat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gnat</a> <a href="https://t.co/ajvLt2H5bo">pic.twitter.com/ajvLt2H5bo</a></p>&mdash; LaurenceMillar (@LaurenceMillar) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenceMillar/status/931795364843200513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2017</a></blockquote>

If you're looking for a conversation topic, remember that at a meetup or conference, you'll generally have the first-order topic of "we are here because of R (or machine learning, python, etc). But there are some meatier second-order questions you can dive into, like: Why this meetup? What got you interested in R? Have you read any good articles lately blatantly misusing statistics?"(Thanks to my colleague [Jake Voytko](https://twitter.com/jakevoytko) for these suggestions). People love to talk about themselves, and everyone is someone you can learn from. 

### Try out Twitter

There's a great, friendly R community on twitter. You can announce when you're going to a conference, ask technical questions, and share your work. It can also be a way to break the ice when you finally meet someone in person. For example, I ran into Jenny Bryan last year at RStudio::conf; we'd never talked before, but I been following her on twitter which helped me "know" her a bit. You can even [say a "virtual" hello](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-your-personal-brand-as-a-new-web-developer-f6d4150fd217) (as written about by Rick West, along with some excellent insights on building a personal brand) beforehand if you know you'll both be at the same conference. [Discuss creepiness here? Or, how not to be a creeper?.. I think it could be funny: A virtual hello is friendly. Virtual ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be at Rstatsny what hotel are you staying in, where are you eating, are you bringing Chairman Meow (#adorbs), are you going to wear the same pink sweater you wore last year, because it is so #fetch‚Äù is an invitation to a restraining order.  ]

On the technical question side, you can try out the rstats hashtag. Just the other week [I tweeted] asking if anyone could advise on setting a global color palette for ggplot2: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> twitter: is there a way to globally set the color scale for ggplot2? theme_set() seems to work only for background.</p>&mdash; Emily Robinson (@robinson_es) <a href="https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/943500138265399296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I got a lot of good responses, including one introducing me to the awesome [ggthemr package](https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr). I then paid it forward by tweeting about the discovery:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">TIL how to set a global color palette for ggplot2 with ggthemr! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/czeildi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@czeildi</a> for the great post <a href="https://t.co/svW7A9szTA">https://t.co/svW7A9szTA</a> <a href="https://t.co/bZjfm3IZFg">pic.twitter.com/bZjfm3IZFg</a></p>&mdash; Emily Robinson (@robinson_es) <a href="https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/943549279595126785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You'll often even find Hadley Wickham answering questions on twitter; I think it's more polite to use the rstats hashtag rather than to @ him directly, but he usually answers questions specifically directed to him as well.  

Twitter is confusing! It's totally okay to spend a while just injesting content. Some great people to follow on twitter include Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham), Jesse Maegan (@kierisi), David Robinson (@drob), Jenny Bryan (@jennybryan), Mara Averick (@dataandme), and Maelle Salmon (@ma_salmon). 

Lots of greate twitter tips from Rachel Thomas post. 

### Combining the two

Serves as notes for myself, useful for other people.  

It's become expected of me: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yay! And let the live tweeting begin! üôå (no pressure üòÅ)</p>&mdash; Daniela V√°zquez (@d4tagirl) <a href="https://twitter.com/d4tagirl/status/940730957128175616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2017</a></blockquote>

### Next Time

So you've started to meet people and understand data science world more generally. But then you read a really cool post by XYZ and you'd love to follow up with them. How do you reach out to specific people? 

# Part 2

Whether in applying for a job, getting a promotion, or establishing a reputation in your broader field, you've probably heard something along the lines of "it's all about who you know." So how does one go about building this all-important network: By sending out a million unsolicited linkedin requests with no message to every person with the title "data scientist;" making it a goal to hand out 20 business cards at a meetup once a week; or sending emails to prominent data scientists with the subject line "Can I pick you brain?"

**Absolutely not**.

Building a network is not a numbers game, and it's not about looking to get the largest personal benefit from the least time invested. But, unfortunately, that's how some people approach it. I wrote this post to offer some suggestions for a better way.

Two important caveats to start, both inspired by other posts on similar topics. First, to quote [Trey Causey](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d): "I am not without sin, and I'm also still figuring all this out." Second, for those of you who hate the very idea of networking and think your work should speak for yourself, I really like [Rachel Thomas'](http://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/) take on this. She's writing about personal branding, but I think there's a lot of overlap there (as I discuss later): 

> Personal branding is no substitute for doing high-quality technical work; it‚Äôs just the means by which you can share this work with a broader audience.

## Reaching Out to Specific People

### Share what you like about their work

A friend who's well-known in the R community shared how many of his first conversations at meetups or conferences go: 

> Them: "I love your work!"

> My friend: "Great, thank you."

> Both: awkward silence ...

Whether it's over email or in-person, tell the other person **which part of their work** helped you and **end with a question**. For example, if you run into [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) at Rstudio::conf, you could say, "I really enjoy reading the data science work you share on twitter! I work with a lot of dates, and when you tweeted a cheatsheet for lubridate it really helped. Do you have a favorite cheatsheet?" Help them help you to by coming up with a good conversation topic, and talking about yourself a bit can avoid awkward fangirling.

Over email, it's even more important to show you're familiar with their work. [Mark Meloon](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) describes this well:

> The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements. Which is too bad because that‚Äôs really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?‚Äù to their message.

And if you don't know anything about their work, and they do have a public presence (either github, a blog, or twitter), why are you reaching out? Just like when applying for a job, you should do some research. If they have a post on what they think of the [data science job market](http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html), don't message them "what can you tell me about the data science job market?" Show them you've read their work and ask follow-up questions. 

A lot of points about applying for a job apply: do your research, don't be late, follow-up. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3 Don&#39;t hop on a screening call without knowing who you&#39;re talking to first. Spend the 5-10 minutes that it takes to Google them and find something they&#39;ve done that&#39;s interesting and relevant to you. Yes, it&#39;s more work. Do you want the job or not?</p>&mdash; Kieran Snyder (@KieranSnyder) <a href="https://twitter.com/KieranSnyder/status/948614223537426432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2018</a></blockquote>

### Offer value

True networking is about building a relationship, not a one-sided demand where you just want to get something immediately. And the best way to build mutually fulfilling relationships is to have something of value to offer in return. 

While people sometimes think you need a network to accomplish great things, it actually mostly goes the other way. Adam Grant wrote about this in a [recent article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/opinion/sunday/networking-connections-business.html?_r=0)

> My students often believe that if they simply meet more important people, their work will improve. But it‚Äôs remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you‚Äôve already put something valuable out into the world. That‚Äôs what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take.

> Sure, you can fire off cold emails to people you respect ‚Äî they‚Äôre just a click away ‚Äî but you‚Äôll be lucky if 2 percent even reply. The best way to attract a mentor is to create something worthy of the mentor‚Äôs attention. Do something interesting, and instead of having to push your way in, you‚Äôll get pulled in. The network comes to you.

In sum, [don't worry about who you know, but be worth knowing.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d63bc4e4b0e383f5b2a05a/t/5655fa1de4b0f60cdb986ad5/1448475165543/Job+market+advice+for+PhDs+November2015-2.pdf). 

So how do you become "worth knowing?" Build your personal brand. Rachel Thomas just wrote a [fantastic post](http://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/) on this, covering what a brand even means, how to get over the "ick" factor, and how to use twitter, public speaking, and blogging to do so. For more advice, check out [Dave Robinson's post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) and [Rachel Thomas' other post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) on why you should make a blog and where to start. While having code on github is good, data scientists also need communication skills. Plus, it's just more likely people will read a post summarizing the main takeaways and methods rather than trying to parse thousands of lines of barely commented code. 

### Find a connection

To make it more likely you‚Äôll get a response, try to find if you have something in common with the other person. Maybe you both went to same school or same bootcamp. Do you have a similar educational background or career, especially one that is not traditional?  It doesn't have to be career-related; maybe you both have the same a non-tech hobby or spent time living abroad in the same country. Check with your school or bootcamp's career center to see if there is someone at a company you're interested in. 

A mutual acquaintance can also serve as a connection. If you have a good conversion with someone, you can ask them (not demand) if they know anyone else in the same field.<sup>1</sup> For example, recently Julia Silge, a data scientist I know at StackOverflow, asked if she could connect me to [Lukas Vermeer](https://lukasvermeer.github.io), a data scientist at booking.com. He was interested in talking to people about their company's experimentation set-up, and we had a great conversation. I then introduced him to Sarah Manning, the manager of our analytics engineering team, as she had talked to some of his colleagues at a conference. Important note: when doing introductions, always do a **double opt-in introduction**, where you ask both people if they're interested in being introduced to the other (hat tip [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/893953892404297728) for this advice).

### Know their weight class

Reaching out to Hadley Wickham or Jenny Bryan very different from reaching out to me. They're busier, more well known. May not have time to respond. They're at the scale where better to make a public post and share broadly, especially if questions are more generally, like "how do I get into data science?" See Jessee Magen's post. 

If you do want to start talking to those people or get them to know your work, the value add is really, really critical here. 

### Get specific

Trey Causey wrote a great [post](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d) called "Do you have time for a quick chat?" on sending a cold email. Go ahead and read it- I'll wait. He does a really nice job breaking down how to write a great request email and set up a meeting for success. A key point: have an agenda of what you want to discuss and share it with them. If you just ask to "pick their brain," it comes off as you wanting the person to [drop everything just so you can assail them](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) with any question you can think of, potentially for hours. 

### Following up

If you have a good conversation with someone and they help you with something, follow up! For example, if you were looking for a job, let them know when you found one and thank them.  

If you were introduced to someone or have a connection with them and haven't heard back, give them a week or two and follow up. Sometimes emails just fall through the cracks and they'll appreciate being reminded. If it's a cold email, use your judgment about whether to follow up. 

Finally, don't take non-responses personally. People are busy, and you don't know what is happening in their personal life. 

## Conclusion

Fulfilling networking is, at its heart, about building great relationships and becoming part of a community. As I've discussed in [previous posts](https://robinsones.github.io/Making-R-Code-Faster-A-Case-Study/), part of the reason I choose to program in R is because I've found an incredibly supportive community. People (even us strong introverts!) are social, and we generally have more fun and are more productive when we can lean on each other for help. 

The main way I try to offer value is through these posts, and I'll be back to tackling the [challenges of A/B Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF-ryGgLOgQ) soon. 

[1] Never talk to someone just to get an introduction to someone else. 

#### Things to mention somewhere

https://www.datahelpers.org/ - people want to help. Good resource for finding someone to reach out to. 

Mikhail Popov great post on for those folks starting out - https://mpopov.com/blog/advice-for-grads-entering-industry-datasci. 

can use newsletters to keep up datacamp and rweekly and o'reilly media.

Potential stories: 
- I'm an introvert. This generally surprises people. Introversion doesn't equal shyness, but rather about getting your [energy from being alone](https://shazzbaa.deviantart.com/art/Hi-I-am-an-Introvert-391255742
) rather than socializing. But this is all still not natural to me. What really has helped is to think about it as promoting my work, not myself, and about helping other people. 


- twitter, also started out with few twitter followers. but twitter can first be a learning platform, rather than a self-promotion (learn what people are talking about, what is going on.
