No matter how long you've been in the work world (or even before you've entered it), you've probably heard about the importance of networking. Whether in applying for a job, getting a promotion, or establishing a reputation in your broader field, having a ...

Almost every day on linkedin I get a request from someone I don't know with no message. Usually it's someone with the title data scientist, "talent acquisition," or blah. 

### Find a connection

Try to find if you have something in common with the other person. Maybe you both went to same school or same bootcamp. Do you have a similar educational background or career, especially one that is not traditional?  It doesn't have to be career-related; maybe you both have the same a non-tech hobby or spent time living abroad in the same country. Check with your school or bootcamp's career center to see if there is someone at a company you're interested in. 

A connection can also be a mutual acquaintice. If you have a good conversion with someone, you can ask them (not demand) if they know anyone else in the same field.<sup>1</sup> For example, recently Julia Silge, a data scientist I know at StackOverflow, connected me to [Lukas Vermeer](https://lukasvermeer.github.io), a data scientist at booking.com. He was interested in talking to people about their company's experimentation set-up, and we had a great conversation. I then introduced him to Sarah Manning, the manager of our analytics engineering team, as she had talked to some of his colleagues at a conference. Note: when doing introductions, always do a double opt-in introduction (hat tip [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/893953892404297728).

### Get specific

Trey Causey wrote a great [post](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d) called "Do you have time for a quick chat?" on sending a cold email. Go ahead and read it, I'll wait. He does a really nice job breaking down how to write a great request email and set up a meeting for success. A key point: have an agenda of what you want to discuss and share it with them. If you just ask to "pick their brain," it comes off as you wanting the person to [drop everything just so you can assail them](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) with any question you can think of, potentially for hours. 

### Offer value

True networking is about making connection, not about getting something. Don't ask for a referral in your first message to a person. If they can do it and you have a good conversation where you mention you're looking, they'll probably offer. 

Adam Grant - accomplishing things leads to network. Henning - don't worry about knowing people, be worth knowing.  

[Adam Grant article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/opinion/sunday/networking-connections-business.html?_r=0)
* "Accomplishing great things helps you develop a network". Have a public body of work. Go read [Dave's blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) on why you should start a blog and also the how. . Medium is a great way to get started easily, also can get you wider visibility, but Jekyll too. Having code on github is good, but data scientists also need communication skills. Plus just more likely people will read that than 1000s of lines of barely commented code. 

Don't ask if you can ping them with questions as you're learning. That's best served by online resources like datacamp, stack overflow, twitter, etc.

### Share what you like about their work

A friend who's well-known in the R community shared how many of his first conversations at meetups or conferences go: 

> Them: "I love your work!"
> My friend: "Great, thank you."
> Both: awkward silence ...

Whether it's over email or in-person, tell the other person **which part of their work** helped you and how. For example, if you run into [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) at Rstudio::conf, you could say, "Thank you so much for sharing data science work on twitter! The other day you tweeted a cheatsheet for lubridate, and I shared it with my coworkers right away. I really like how you include screenshots when linking to blog posts, so I can get a quick preview." Help them help you to by coming up with a good conversation topic. 

Over email, it's even more important to show you're familiar with their work. [Mark Meloon](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) describes this well:

> The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements. Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an “I’d love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?” to their message.

And if you don't know anything about their work, and they do have a public presence (either github, a blog, or twitter), why are you reaching out? Just like when applying for a job, you should do some research. If they have a post on what they think of the [data science job market](http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html), don't message them "what can you tell me about the data science job market?" Show them you've read their work and ask follow-up questions. 

### Meeting people 

#### In person
Check out the meetups in your community. If you're in New York, I highly recommend the (New York Open Statistical Programming meetup)[https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/]; if you're a woman, check out groups like [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), [Women who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), and [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/) who have chapters all over the world. Stick around after the meetup; there might be an after-event (the NY Open Statistical Programming meetup invites everyone to a bar after the meetup), but even if there isn't, some people will likely stick around and you can meet them when it's less crowded. You can also talk to the organizers; they're almost definitely friendly folks and can maybe introduce you to others who share your interests. If you're nervous about going somewhere where you don't know anyone, you can bring a friend, but don't just stick with them. 

#### Online

There's a great, friendly R community on twitter. You can announce going to conference, ask questions, and share your work. It can be way to break ice at conference. For example, I met Jenny Bryan last year at RStudio::conf; we'd never talked before, but I been following her on twitter which helped me "know" her a bit. You can even [say a "virtual" hello](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-your-personal-brand-as-a-new-web-developer-f6d4150fd217) if you know you'll both be at the same conference. You'll often find Hadley Wickham answering questions on twitter; I think it's more polite to use the rstats hashtag rather than to @ him directly, but he usually answers questions directed by him as well.  

### Following up

If you have a good conversation with someone and they help you with something, follow up! For example, if you were looking for a job, let them know when you found one and thank them.  

If you were introduced to someone or have a connection with them and haven't heard back, give them a week or two and follow up. Sometimes emails just fall through the cracks and they'll appreciate being reminded. If it's a cold email, use your judgment about whether to follow up. 

Finally, don't take non-responses personally. People are busy, and you don't know what is happening in their personal life.

* "But it’s remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you’ve already put something valuable out into the world. That’s what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take."
*  "Do something interesting, and instead of having to push your way in, you’ll get pulled in. The network comes to you."
*  "It shouldn’t be about promoting yourself, but about promoting your ideas." - my take, it can also be about helping other people. For example, writing my first data science talk. 

[Mark Meloon advice](http://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/) on networking
- "But most of the messages are all about “getting something”, not legitimate attempts to build any kind of relationship. 

Most of the messages I get are like the above, where someone asks me out of the blue if we have any openings. Sometimes people will be as bold as to ask me if I could refer them"
-" But this individual made no attempt to try to establish any kind of relationship with me. I’m simply a tool to help him get what he wants."
- "Every once in awhile, I get an open-ended request to get on a phone or Skype call so someone can “pick my brain”. No duration specified, no agenda. No specific questions. They want me to drop everything I’m doing and let them pepper me with every question they can think of."
- "The truly baffling thing is that the messages I get fall into two categories: those thanking me for my posts on job hunting and those who want to get something from me. Very, very rarely do I get messages that combine both of these elements.

Which is too bad because that’s really the way to do it. People who are familiar with my content and compliment me on it stand a much better chance of me helping them. They are in a great position to tack on an “I’d love to learn a little more about the work you do at (company). Can I ask you a few questions?” to their message."
- " If you are going to reach out to experienced data scientists, don’t make your first message all about you and what you want. Make it about them (mostly). Comment on something they’ve posted. Point them to a helpful resource. Offer to share their content. Maybe ask them something about their profile."

[Mentoring post](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stop-asking-people-to-mentor-you/)

Asking a virtual stranger to mentor you probably isn't going to get you far. "The strongest relationships spring out of a real and often earned connection felt by both sides." Studies, she writes, "show that mentors select proteges based on performance and potential." Given this, "I believe we have sent the wrong message to young women. We need to stop telling them, 'Get a mentor and you will excel.' Instead, we need to tell them, 'Excel and you will get a mentor.'

### My benefits

Things that I've gotten to do based on public talks and blog
- West Point talk (show photo) 
- Robert Chang (shared his work, he reached out to me, had read my stuff too)
- RStudio Conference (had an example talk to link them to) 
- Saw other people inspired by my talk write their own (share tweet about her blog post) 

### Branding
Building a personal brand https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-your-personal-brand-as-a-new-web-developer-f6d4150fd217
- it's for developers, but I think applies equally to data science. 
- disagree on blogging "light" but agree with this: Finally, try and remember that all your posts don’t have to be too technical. Even if you are a complete beginner, you will always have 1 day, 1 week or 1 month’s more experience than someone else. Someone will find value in what you have to say. 
- It can be worthwhile I think not just using it to have a presence and way of contact but to add value. Takes more time, but I think that time can also be learning time in this field. 
- It’s also a great way to break the ice and say a virtual “hello” before bumping into someone at an in-person conference or meet-up.
