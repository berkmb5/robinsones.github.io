### The Bright Blue Horror

Coming into Metis, I knew one of the hardest parts would be switching from R to Python. Beyond simply having much more experience in R, I had come to rely on Hadley Wickham's great set of R packages for data science. One of these is ggplot2, a data visualizaiton package. While there is a version of [ggplot2 for python](http://ggplot.yhathq.com), I decided to learn the main plotting system in Python, matplotlib. Then I actually created and saw my first matplotlib, and promptly sent my brother the following texts:

Fortunately, he wrote back quickly suggesting I try Seaborn, and my bootcamp experience was saved. Six weeks later, I've become known in Metis as a seaborn evangelicalist. Not a plot on presentation days goes by without me marking down if it uses base matplotlib aesthetics. I then follow up with those people, asking I ask them why they don't use seaborn, usually followed by, â€œIs it to make me sad?"

### The Great ggplot2 versus Base R Wars

Back in February, Jeff Leek, an Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Oncology at John Hopkins and co-director of the popular John Hopkins specialization in data science on cousera, made a blog post entitled ["Why I don't use ggplot2"](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/).
