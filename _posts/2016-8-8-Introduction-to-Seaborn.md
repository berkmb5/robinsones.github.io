Intro

Coming into Metis, I knew one of the hardest parts would be switching from programming in R to Python. Besides simply an experience difference, R has a great set of packages for data science courtesy of Hadley Wickham that I had relied on heavily in my work. One of these is ggplot2, a graphics package. While there is a version of ggplot2 in python (ggplot by Å·hat), I decided I should learn the main plotting system in Python, matplotlib. Then I actually created and saw my first matplotlib.
