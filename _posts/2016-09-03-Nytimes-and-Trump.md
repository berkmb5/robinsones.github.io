## Trump's Presidential Campaign and the Media

 When Donald Trump first entered the Republican presidential primary on June 16, 2015, no media outlet seemed to take him seriously as a contender. FiveThirtyEight, one of the most prominent political polling websites,  said Trump ["has a better chance of cameoing in another “Home Alone” movie with Macaulay Culkin — or playing in the NBA Finals — than winning the Republican nomination.”] (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/). Politico considered his speech a [“bizarre spectacle”](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/donald-trump-2016-announcement-10-best-lines-119066) that was one of the most entertaining ones in the 2016 political season so far. NYTimes wrote about ["suspicions that he is entering the race mainly to appear in debates and win attention from the media.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real-he-says.html?_r=0)
 
By any measure Donald Trump is an unusual presidential candidate. If elected, he would be one of the few presidents who had never held elected office, and the only one who has not served in the military or been appointed to political office instead. Before his run, he was best known to many Americans as a reality television star on his series “The Apprentice.” In the primary, many career politicians and political observers expressed disbelief at his belief to say many controversial and inflammatory statements that could end the of the race for another candidate.

Some in the media have admitted that they, and the media more generally, don't know how to cover him, both in the [primary](http://mashable.com/2015/12/02/the-media-just-doesnt-know-what-to-do-with-donald-trump/#RpvubaWmO8q3) and now as the [Republican nominee](https://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2016-08-11/challenges-for-the-media-in-covering-donald-trump). Trump himself has criticized the media’s coverage of him:
