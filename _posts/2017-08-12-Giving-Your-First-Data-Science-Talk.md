## Introduction

Two weeks ago, I gave my first ever data science talk. Jared Lander, organizer of the  [New York Statistical Open Programming meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/), had been asking me to speak, and after about six months at Etsy I felt I had something worthwhile to share. 

This is part one of a blog post series about the talk. This first post is targeted to those who are considering giving a meetup or conference talk. The next one will be covering what I went over in my talk. The final one will be distilling more of what I’ve learned about A/B Testing from my time at Etsy and by reading papers. 

## Why do a Talk? 
*Disclaimer*

I want to preface this section by acknowledging that it is more difficult for some people to give talks than others. I live in New York, a major tech city, but for those who live in places where the tech community is smaller, there may not be a meetup for you to speak at or a large audience that you can draw. That being said, there are more of us than you might think; Rladies has chapters in over [40 cities](https://rladies.org) and you may be surprised when you look to see what your community can offer. 

The second major constraint is time.

MORE NEEDED! 

For those who have caregiving responsibilities or simply want to keep their work mainly limited to the office, doing a talk may not be feasible or appealing.

*Giving Back*

On the other hand, if you’re considering giving a talk but think you don’t have anything to contribute, don’t underestimate yourself! You probably have more to offer than you think. The main reason an open source language can thrive is because of a commuity. Certainly one way to give back is contributing code, but you can also give talks or write blog posts. I've benefited a lot from the free resources provided in the R community (such as the great [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickaham, the [many](http://www.masalmon.eu) [blogs](http://livefreeordichotomize.com), and of course the whole language and its set of packages). While I haven't made or contributed to a public package (yet!), I believe that this blog and recorded, free talks can help.

was contacted my major at west point, asked to give lecture to faculty, because he had seen the recording of my talk. Going up for a day in the fall. 

## Giving a Talk 

*Target the you of six months (one year, five years) ago*
One of my favorite parts about working at Etsy is the womenby (women and non-binary) in tech group here. We have a private slack channel, and the day after my talk, a senior engineer was asking for opinions on an upcoming talk. She wanted to frame the talk as a story about how they built a distributed streaming platform on docker and the mistakes they made, but she worried it would make her and her team look inexperienced and possibly stupid for not anticipating the difficulties. 

My advice was to think of yourself before taking on this project and ask if you would have found it useful then. I would bet most of the time the answer is yes, and that the audience is more similar to you six months ago then you after this experience. 

*Don’t have text or idea heavy slides*
Having seen the extremes of multiple paragraphs in size 10 font literally read off of a slide, I thought I was pretty well. But on one slide, even though there were only about 20 words in six nice little boxes, I was trying to cover six points in one go! So I switched to only cover three points and have about four slides for each of them.

While it’s fine to start out with text-heavy slides as an outline for your talk, cut it down as you go! You want to make sure you’re not using your slides as your speaker notes. 

Also try to vary your slides up as well with memes, gifs, screenshots of tweets, etc. You don’t want to take your audience through 50 slides of bullet points only, even if each only has one idea expressed in a few sentences. 

I highly advise you to check out [this deck on slide design](https://speakerdeck.com/mseckington/the-art-of-slide-design) for more tips and examples. 

*Practice, practice, practice (and ask for feedback!)*
This sounds pretty basic, but it can be easy to procrastinate on preparing the talk and feel just reading over the slides is fine. Fortunately as an Etsy employee I had to submit my slides to our communication and legal teams ahead of time, so I was forced to make my slides early. 

Starting two weeks before my presentation, I practiced with five different people (a few multiple times). Try to get people with different backgrounds: I practiced with fellow and former Etsy analysts, but also with my non-technical (but presentation expert) sister-in-law. Their advice was very helpful in improving the slides and the talk, but I also found that simply giving the talk out loud helped me see where transitions or slides didn’t work. 

*Rally your support team* 
While I feel fairly comfortable with public speaking, I’d never done it to an audience this size or on data science. I was also shy about promoting my talk. 

This is where your supporters can come in to help. My manager advertised my talk at work, my brother tweeted about it, and the other NYC rladies organizers promoted it in our slack channel. They all also came to the talk (my brother almost straight off a flight from London!) and gave me some friendly faces in the audience. 

And finally, if your nerves start overcoming you before your talk, just remember this classic and sage advice from one of my search engineering partners:
