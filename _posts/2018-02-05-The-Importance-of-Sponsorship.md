## Sponsorship vs. Mentorship 
- Women are overmentored and undersponsored https://hbr.org/2010/08/women-are-over-mentored-but-un
  - generally mentorship is about getting advice, showing you the ropes at your new job
  - sponsorship is helping that person get a promotion, making sure they get good assignments, giving them opportunities. Has to be someone highly placed. 
  - Women have as many if not more mentors, but men's mentors more likely to be senior. Men correlation between mentor and promotion, women not
  
## Not just the workplace

A lot of articles about sponsorship and mentorship are about getting one at your company. And that can be really important if you work at a larger organization and want to stay in your company for many years rising through the ranks. But nowadays people often change companies, especially in technology. And portions of the data science world are small enough you can start getting a reputation in the larger field which will help you. 

## How do you find a sponsor? 

Build a relationship naturally - don't just go "will you be my sponsor?" Don't ask over email to someone you've met, and don't ask in your few meetings. Lots of my advice in the post on reaching out applies. Even more so, if someone sponsors you, they need to be confident you will do a good job, because you're representing them. For example, if someone recommends you as a speaker and you never respond to the organizer or you don't prepare and give a bad talk, that reflects on them. Can convince them with evidence of your work. It doesn't have to be evidence of you doing the exact same thing. For example, Mikhil Popov's post on how to deal with the catch-22 of needing experience to get experience https://mpopov.com/blog/advice-for-grads-entering-industry-datasci. How can you get a data science job without ever having one? Show you can do the work by doing your own analysis on real data and explaining it. If you've never done a full talk before, start with a lightning talk. Many meetups have them. Or show your blog post. Be an active member of the meetup, ask good questions, be respectful. 

## How can you be a sponsor? 

If you're a seasoned speaker, think about recommending others for opportunities, especially when you can't go yourself.

Caitlin Hudon has a great twitter thread on this. https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/895799250055024640. Some examples she give: colleagues praising her work in front of her boss, sharing their salary information, asking about parental leave policy, and promoting work of women. Latter can even be just tweeting. Asking what you can do better. Support women-focused group, offering time, training materials, meeting spaces, etc.

Some examples of mine: 
- RStudio conference, with money - gave me diversity scholarship for conference 2017. Enabled me to go to conference and training days. 
- Hilary Parker recommending me to speak at Data Day Texas. Was my first conference talk. 
- Jared Lander having me give my first data science talk at his meetup. He was very enthusiastic, insistent, champion of me. He believed I could do it before I did. Got to talk at west point, which was awesome. 
- Dave Robinson, for everything. Especially helping boost my data science profile. His international women day tweets. got lots of follwers for all of us. 


And some encouragement: 
- Hadley Wickham encouraging me to submit my talk to RStudio conference 2018
- Jim Hester citing me as one of the contributors to the glue documentation.

## Diversity and sponsorship

Care about diversity. This one is about how men can be an ally to women and non-binary people. Worth reading whole thing: https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/. Important post below:
