A summary of my experience writing syntax in STATA:
* Yelling at the computer alternatively â€œI know how to do this in R!" and "This is better/easier/prettier in R!"
* Googling my problems and being directed to [old](http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2010-04/msg01673.html) [listserv](http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2009-04/msg00976.html) [posts](http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2007-09/msg00099.html) insead of the beautiful [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12357592/efficient-multiplication-of-columns-in-a-data-frame) [answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4203442/for-loop-vs-while-loop-in-r) I had been spoiled with when using R. 
* Wishing there was a way to create reproducible documents with code, output, and explanations as I did with R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks
